# Fedora Post Install Script

A small shell script for personal use, forked from FHEK789. Thanks mate! I've made a good few changes here, but kept the original structure.
Now that I mainly use Fedora, this'll setup my daily driver/gaming machine the way that works best. Feel free to peruse the bash script to see if the programs in the program list are right for you.

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/fedora-postinstall.git
cd fedora-postinstall
chmod +x fedora.sh
./fedora.sh
```
