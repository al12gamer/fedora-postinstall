# Fedora Post Install Script

A small shell script for personal use, originally forked from FHEK789. Now, I've gone ahead and migrated everything to Ansible for easier installation and version control. 

## Quick Start
Note that you will need Ansible installed for this script to run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/al12gamer/fedora-postinstall.git
cd fedora-postinstall
chmod +x fedora.sh
./fedora.sh
```

## License
Have a look at the [license file](./LICENSE) for details.
